    "## Keplers Laws of Satellite Orbits\n",
    "Johannes Kepler lived in Graz Austria in the 17th century. Kepler was forced to leave Graz due to religious turmoil at the time.  He found a position working for the famous astronomer Tyco Brahe in Prague.  He was tasked with understanding the orbit of mercury which at the time did not fit into any mathematical models accurately.  After a long struggle, he was able to determine that planetary orbits were elliptical using Tyco’s extensive astronomical data.  This led him to discover the three law's of planatary orbit which were named after him[5]<br>\n",
